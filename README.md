# Command Block Language Server - CBLS
### A language server for CBScript

**Version**: v0.1.2

CBLS provides developers with a set of language features to improve the experience of coding in 'cbscript' (developed by SethBling).

This is a push to provide community made software which aids the development in cbscript.

CBLS is written in Python, this is because this is my first time implementing the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

I hope to redo this project in Rust in the future.

### Features
These are the features I'd like to have implemented, with its current progression

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcomed, this is my first in-depth project in making an LSP, let alone both a lexer and parser.
